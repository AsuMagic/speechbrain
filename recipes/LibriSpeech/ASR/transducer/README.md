# LibriSpeech ASR with Transducer models.
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the LibriSpeech dataset;
Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed (pip install numba)
You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12

# Extra-Dependencies
This recipe supports two implementations of the transducer loss, see `use_torchaudio` arg in the yaml file:
1. Transducer loss from torchaudio (this requires torchaudio version >= 0.10.0) (Default).
2. Speechbrain implementation using Numba. To use it, please set `use_torchaudio=False` in the yaml file. This version is implemented within SpeechBrain and  allows you to directly access the python code of the transducer loss (and directly modify it if needed).

Note: Before running this recipe, make sure numba is installed. Otherwise, run:
```
pip install numba
```

# How to run it
```shell
python train.py train/train.yaml
```

# Librispeech Results

Dev. clean is evaluated with Greedy Decoding while the test sets are using Greedy Decoding OR a RNNLM + Beam Search.
