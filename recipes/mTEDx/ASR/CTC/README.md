# mTEDx ASR with CTC models.
This folder contains the scripts to train a wav2vec based system using mTEDx. You can train either a single-language wav2vec model or multilingual
wav2vec model. Before running this recipe, make sure to read this [README](../../README.md) file first.

**Note:**\
Wav2vec model used in this recipe is pre-trained on the French language.
In order to use another language, don't forget to change the `wav2vec2_hub`
in the `train_wav2vec.yaml` YAML file. 


# How to run

To train a single-language wav2vec model, run:
```bash
$ python train.py hparams/train_wav2vec.yaml
```

To train a multilingual wav2vec model, run:
```bash
$ python train.py hparams/train_xlsr.yaml
```
